# Monster Killer Game

###### This site asks for a number before the page loads (i.e., the maximum life of the player).

###### After loading, the user/player can launch an **ATTACK**, **STRONG ATTACK**, or **HEAL THEMSELF**.

###### Each operation launched leads to a subsequent **ATTACK** by the monster.

###### Winner is declared based on the **last man standing** (monitoring the Monster's & Player's health). The player gets a bonus life

###### The verdict is declared inside an alert. Game resets after this, but the bonus life is not restored.

## This is my practice project to learn

- JavaScript ES6 (let, const, template literals)
- Functions and control flow (if-else, ternary, function declarations)
- DOM manipulation and event handling (addEventListener)
- Array and object manipulation (push, object literals)
- Debugging and logging (console.log)
- Type conversion and validation (parseInt)
- Function context and binding (bind)
- Arithmetic and logical operations
- Game state management and UI interaction
- Code organization and modularity
